## Plan on improving the project

I would like change the style of the menu. I feel like it's plain. I would put some illustrative images in the corner of the menu. For example an illustarative image of one of the two drinks we offer. I would Also want some text styles to be in there. Instead of the span underline I would like to make it dotted.
